1. Load and Inspect Data
- Load the dataset into R.
- Check the structure of the data: Look at column names and data types. 
- Repeat for the secondary dataset.

2. Clean the Data (check for missing values or outliers, filter out the data as required, rename columns as required)

3. Merge the two datasets as per requirement.

4. Analysis
- Summarize the data: Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for batting_strike_rate, boundaries_percent, balls_faced, and batting_avg.
- Check correlations: Use correlation coefficients to see how strongly each factor is related to batting_strike_rate.

5. Create Visualizations
- Scatter Plots, box plots, and histograms
- Add appropriate titles, axis labels, and legends to all plots.

6. Report Writing
- Use the QMD format to write the report. Include these sections:
Introduction
Data Description
Methodology
Results
Conclusion
- Render to pdf

7. Code Appendix
Include all your R code in a separate section at the end of the QMD report.
Make sure it is well-commented and follows a style guide.

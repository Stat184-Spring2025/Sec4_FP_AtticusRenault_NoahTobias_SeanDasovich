1. Load and Inspect Data
- Load main dataset (Batting statistics from Baseball Savant) into R.
-Load the second dataset (Player league and position from Baseball Reference) into R.
- Check the structure of the data: Look at column names and data types. 

2. Clean the Data (check for missing values or outliers, filter out the data as required, rename columns as required)

3. Merge the two datasets by player name to combine batting statistics with league and position info.

4. Analysis
- Summarize the data: Calculate mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation for key variables (home_run, walk, strikeout %, intentional walk, average swing speed, launch angle, hard-hit %, whiff %).
- Calculate the correlation matrix to examine how swing speed is related to other batting statistics.


5. Create Visualizations
- Create scatter plots to visualize relationships (e.g., swing speed vs home runs, swing speed vs strikeout %).
- Create a correlation heatmap to show relationships between all variables.

6. Report Writing
- Use the QMD format to write the report. Include these sections:
Introduction
Data Description
Methodology
Results
Conclusion
- Render to pdf

7. Code Appendix
Include all your R code in a separate section at the end of the QMD report.
Make sure it is well-commented and follows a style guide.

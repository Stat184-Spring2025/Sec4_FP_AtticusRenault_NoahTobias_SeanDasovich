# Introduction

Tracking statistics has been a core part of baseball since its birth in the 19th century. What began as tabulating hits and runs has evolved into batting averages, on base percentages, and complex measures of a player's "win contribution". The 2011 movie *Moneyball*, based on the Oakland Athletics 2002 season, brought advanced metrics to the public's eye and revealed statistics as a core component to gaining a competitive edge. This hyper-analysis of player performance is commonly referred to today as "sabermetrics". One of the key stats that emerged out of the data revolution was bat speed. The basic principle that "the harder you swing, the farther the ball goes" has become increasingly valuable in the modern game, which emphasizes home runs and big hits. This paper explores the relationship between bat speed and other metrics, assessing its advantages and trade-offs. 

In this project, we explore two core research questions:

1.  What factors (e.g., home runs, whiff %, strikeout %, hard hit %, average launch angle) is bat speed the best indicator of for Major League Baseball batters?
2.  Is a batter's birthplace an indicator of bat speed?

These questions aim to understand bat speed's place in baseball today and the role upbringing has in its development in young players. The insights from this data analysis could influence multiple levels of the baseball pipeline. At the scouting stage, knowing how upbringing relates to batter tendencies enhances expectation, and once in the League, bat speed could provide an anchor point for teams to build around.

# Data Provenance

For this project, we used two datasets. The primary dataset is most helpful in addressing the first research question and sets the foundation for the data analysis. The second dataset provides a new perspective on this topic through a more unconventional lens. The two datasets were combined through data wrangling and cleaning processes to produce a final dataset for analysis.

## Primary Dataset

-   Source: Baseball Savant (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/)
-   Description: Baseball Savant, powered by Google Cloud, allows for customized data tables which can then be converted to csv files. We created a custom table that includes all qualified (at least 502 plate appearances) batters from the 2024 regular season. Our custom table includes 19 columns and 129 rows.
-   Purpose: This dataset was used to gather bat speed and related attributes for MLB batters from the 2024 regular season. The information in this table was useful for determining correlation between bat speed and the other commonly collected baseball statistics (hard hit %, strikeout %, etc.)
-   Cases: Each row represents an MLB batter, with columns describing various batting statistics.

## Secondary Dataset



## Data Wrangling

To address our research questions, we integrated the primary and secondary datasets into a single, cleaned dataset:

### Merging:

-   The datasets were merged using the player column from the primary dataset and the Name column from the secondary dataset.
-   The merge allowed us to combine batting performance metrics with metadata like batting style.

### Variable Selection

-   After merging, unnecessary columns such as imgUrl, longName, and other unrelated attributes were dropped.
-   We retained variables directly relevant to our analysis, such as runs, boundaries, balls faced, matches, batting average, batting strike rate, boundaries percentage, and batting style.

### Filtering and Cleaning

-   Players who faced fewer than 100 balls across matches were excluded to ensure that the analysis focused on consistent performers.
-   The final dataset includes only those players who met this threshold, resulting in 92 rows with all required columns.

## Final Dataset

-   Description: The final dataset is a curated selection of the most relevant variables for our analysis, combining performance statistics with metadata like batting styles. It has 92 rows, the 8 selected variables required to answer the research questions, and the player name.
-   Purpose: This dataset enables us to analyze factors influencing batting strike rate and assess the impact of batting style on performance metrics like boundaries and batting average
-   Case: Each row represents an IPL player, with columns capturing their batting statistics and style.

By merging and cleaning the datasets, we ensured that our final data aligns with our research objectives, is reliable, and is focused solely on relevant attributes. This curated dataset provides the foundation for meaningful insights into IPL player performance.

# CARE Principles

Although our data doesnâ€™t include sensitive or community-specific information, we prioritized ethical standards throughout the project. The datasets we used are publicly available, and our analysis was conducted with a focus on fairness and collective benefit. No private information was accessed, and we ensured that all interpretations remained unbiased and responsible.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To derive meaningful insights from our data and address the research questions, we conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This included generating summary tables and creating various visualizations to better understand relationships between key variables and uncover patterns in player performance.

We started by constructing summary tables to provide an overview of key statistics such as runs, boundaries, batting average, strike rate, and more. These tables allowed us to compare metrics across players and batting styles, highlighting trends and differences in performance.

Next, we developed data visualizations to explore deeper relationships and distributions within the dataset:

-   Scatter plots: These helped us visualize how variables like runs, boundaries, balls faced, matches, batting average, batting strike rate, and boundaries percentage relate to batting strike rate, with batting styles distinguished by color.
-   Box plots: These illustrated the distribution of metrics like batting strike rate, batting average and boundaries across different batting styles.
-   Correlation heatmap: This highlighted the strength of relationships between batting strike rate and other performance metrics.
-   Histograms: These revealed the overall distribution of batting strike rates across players.

The insights gained from these analyses form the foundation of our results and conclusions. Below, we detail the most critical tables and visualizations, along with the key insights they helped us derive.

## Descriptive Statistics of Batting Metrics

This table (Table 1) provides an overview of the dataset's key batting performance metrics, including runs, boundaries, boundaries_percent, balls_faced, matches, batting_avg, and strike_rate. The summary statistics (mean, median, minimum, and maximum) offer valuable context about the range and distribution of these variables.



Key Insights:

-   The mean batting strike rate is 125.96, with values ranging from 80.77 to 168.23, highlighting variation in scoring efficiency among players.
-   On average, players faced 1,029 balls, scored 1,327 runs, and hit 170 boundaries, demonstrating the general scale of performance in the dataset.

This table establishes a foundational understanding of the dataset and help us explore relationships further in the context of our analysis.

## Factors Influencing Batting Strike Rate

### Correlation Between Strike Rate and Other Metrics

This correlation heatmap (Figure 1) illustrates the relationships between batting_strike_rate and key batting metrics such as runs, boundaries, boundaries_percent, matches, balls_faced, and batting_avg. The heatmap helps identify the variables that have the strongest influence on batting strike rate



Key Insights:

-   Boundaries_Percent shows the strongest positive correlation with batting_strike_rate, indicating that players who score a higher percentage of their runs through boundaries tend to have higher strike rates. In shorter formats like T20 cricket, where aggressive scoring is crucial, this finding emphasizes the importance of boundary-hitting ability as a primary driver of strike rate. It suggests that players focusing on hitting fours and sixes can significantly impact their teams' scoring pace.
-   Batting_Avg also demonstrates a moderate positive correlation, suggesting that consistent scorers (players with higher batting averages) are more likely to have higher strike rates.
-   Other metrics, such as balls_faced and matches, show minimal or no significant correlation with batting_strike_rate. This implies that these variables, while important for contextualizing a player's career or role in a team, are less critical when analyzing scoring efficiency. For example, players who face more balls or play more matches do not necessarily have higher strike rates, highlighting the limited predictive value of these metrics for scoring efficiency.

The heatmap lays the ground for deeper analysis of boundaries_percent and batting_avg, which are explored further in the scatter plots.

### Scatter Plots

The following scatter plot (Figure 2) shows the relationship between batting_strike_rate and boundaries_percent, with color-coded points representing batting styles (left-hand bat vs. right-hand bat). A loess curve has been added to identify trends.



Key Insights:

-   A strong positive relationship is evident between boundaries_percent and batting_strike_rate. Players with higher percentages of runs from boundaries consistently achieve higher strike rates.
-   The relationship holds true across both batting styles, as evidenced by the overlapping trend line. However, the distribution of players shows some variation, with right-handed batsmen slightly more prevalent at higher boundaries_percent values.
-   This showcases the insight that focusing on aggressive scoring through boundaries is a key factor in driving high strike rates, regardless of batting style, making it an essential strategy for impactful performances in modern cricket.

The scatter plot (Figure 3) examines the relationship between batting_strike_rate and batting_avg, again differentiating batting styles.



Key Insights:

-   A moderate positive relationship is visible between batting_avg and batting_strike_rate. Players with higher averages tend to maintain higher strike rates, though the trend is less pronounced than with boundaries_percent.
-   The loess curve reveals a slightly nonlinear relationship, with strike rates stabilizing at higher batting averages.
-   This suggests that while batting consistency contributes to scoring efficiency, it is not as impactful as boundary-hitting.

Together, these visualizations highlight the significance of boundaries_percent and batting_avg in determining a player's batting strike rate, aligning with the findings from the correlation heatmap.

## Influence of Batting Style on Batting Metrics

### Batting Style Comparison

This table (Table 2) compares key batting metrics between left-handed and right-handed batsmen. The metrics include average runs scored, boundaries hit, batting average, and strike rate.



Key Insights:

-   Right-handed batsmen outperform left-handed batsmen across all metrics, with a higher average of runs (1,423.18 vs. 1,171.54), boundaries (180.77 vs. 153.14), and strike rate (126.79 vs. 124.62). These differences suggest that right-handed batsmen may have an edge in aggressive and impactful scoring.
-   Left-handed batsmen show a slightly better batting average (18.04 vs. 17.94) compared to right-handed batsmen, indicating marginally higher consistency in run-scoring. However, the difference is minimal, suggesting that batting average is not significantly influenced by batting style.
-   Implications: While the differences in metrics are not drastic, they suggest that batting style does have an influence on certain performance metrics, particularly on the ability to score boundaries and maintain a high strike rate. This supports the notion that batting style could be a factor in performance evaluation, especially in shorter cricket formats.

These findings set the stage for the upcoming visualisations, which delve deeper into the relationship between batting style and boundary-hitting ability, as well as total boundaries scored.

### Box Plots

This box plot (Figure 4) illustrates the distribution of boundaries hit by left-handed and right-handed batsmen. It provides a clear comparison of the performance between the two batting styles.



Key Insights:

-   Building on the findings of Table 2, right-handed batsmen have a significantly wider range in the number of boundaries hit, with a higher median and greater maximum values compared to left-handed batsmen.
-   Left-handed batsmen, while consistent, show a smaller range and lower overall performance in boundary hitting.
-   This suggests that batting style plays a role in boundary-hitting ability, with right-handed batsmen generally performing better.

This box plot (Figure 5) compares the batting averages of left-handed and right-handed batsmen.



Key Insights:

-   As seen before, both batting styles show very similar distributions for batting averages, with nearly identical medians and ranges.
-   This reinforces the finding from the batting style comparison table that batting style does not significantly influence batting average.

Given the lack of variability in batting average by batting style, this metric appears less relevant to the differences in performance.

### Stacked Bar Chart

The bar chart (Figure 6) provides a cumulative comparison of the total boundaries hit by left-handed and right-handed batsmen.

 

Key Insights:

-   Right-handed batsmen have hit a substantially higher number of total boundaries compared to left-handed batsmen.
-   This complements the box plot findings and emphasizes the stronger boundary-hitting ability of right-handed batsmen overall.

# Conclusion

This project explored the factors influencing batting strike rate and the impact of batting style on performance metrics such as boundaries and batting average. Our analysis revealed that boundaries percentage has the strongest influence on batting strike rate, followed by batting average, highlighting the importance of aggressive scoring in shorter cricket formats like T20. Batting style significantly impacts boundary-hitting performance, with right-handed batsmen consistently outperforming left-handed batsmen in total and median boundaries hit. However, batting average is largely unaffected by batting style, with both left-handed and right-handed batsmen showing similar distributions and median values. These findings emphasize the nuanced role of batting style in player performance and the critical importance of boundary-hitting ability in driving scoring efficiency. This project demonstrates the value of data-driven insights in sports analytics and provides a foundation for further exploration into player performance dynamics.

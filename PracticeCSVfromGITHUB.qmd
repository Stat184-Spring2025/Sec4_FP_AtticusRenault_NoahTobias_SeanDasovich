## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# Step 1: Read CSV without column names
mlb_data_raw <- read_csv(
  file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stat184-Spring2025/Sec4_FP_AtticusRenault_NoahTobias/refs/heads/main/stats.csv?token=GHSAT0AAAAAAC6ZSB6DDZ7DIIGU44TNHQHA2AKPGHA")
head(mlb_data_raw, 5)
```
